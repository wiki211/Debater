ORGANIZATION
*addpy* and *models* are overarching python modules designed to encompass the total scope of all webpage handlers and database models necessary. The advantage of making large modules stored in a folder is that it enhances the ability for us to collaborate, by splitting critical functions categorically. 

Most importantly, the __init__.py needs to be constantly updated and kept ready as the modules change. Please inform others when you are writing edits to the specific python files within the complex modules. 

These modules can be called by writing from [overarching module name] import * and then directly call the submodule's name.
